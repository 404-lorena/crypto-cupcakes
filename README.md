# Crypto Cupcakes üßÅ
A Cupcake API using Auth0's OIDC for authentication and OAuth for authorization

## Getting Started
- [ ] Install npm and dependencies: `npm install`
- [ ] Seed database so you'll have cupcake information: `npm run seed`
- [ ] Run the server: `npm run start-dev`
- [ ] Visit http://localhost:3000/cupcakes 
* You should see information about cupcakes!
* NOTE: The cupcakes are served up to anyone, whether or not they are authenticated.

## Auth0 Implementation

### Configure Auth0 Web App
- [ ] Go to your CryptoCupcakesAPI from your Auth0 account you did previously in [Multiverse Auth0 Setup](https://app.codingrooms.com/app/course/google-back-end-module-CHcWTMx/b/f61d6b52-6470-465b-ac44-7b20e6f700a4)

<summary>Where to find your CryptoCupcakesAPI?</summary>
<br>
From your Auth0 Dashboard (https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/us/), select Applications, then CryptoCupcakesAPI. You'll then be prompted to do the next following steps below.
</details>

- [ ] Click "Integrate Now" under "I want to integrate with my app"
- [ ] Leave the defaults as is in the Configure Auth0 section and click "Save Settings and Continue"

### Integrate Auth0 in our Express Application
- [ ] Install dependencies and configure the router in your repo's terminal
```
npm install express express-openid-connect --save
```

### Configure Router
The Express OpenID Connect library provides the auth router in order to attach authentication routes to your application. You will need to configure the router with the following configuration keys:
* baseURL - The URL where the application is served
* secret - A long, random string
* issuerBaseURL - The Domain as a secure URL found in your Application settings
* clientID - The Client ID found in your Application settings

- [ ] Require auth at the top
```
const { auth } = require('express-openid-connect');
```

- [ ] Create variables for `.env`
```
const {
  AUTH0_SECRET,
  AUTH0_AUDIENCE = 'http://localhost:3000',
  AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
  AUTH0_BASE_URL,
} = process.env;
```
<details close>
<summary>How to generate a secret string?</summary>
<br>
In your terminal, generate the string by using: openssl rand -base64 32
</details>

- [ ] Define configs in `index.js`
```
const config = {
  authRequired: true,
  auth0Logout: true,
  secret: AUTH0_SECRET,
  baseURL: AUTH0_AUDIENCE,
  clientID: AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
  issuerBaseURL: AUTH0_BASE_URL,
};
```

- [ ]Create `.env` file to define all the variables without sharing it pubically
* AUTH0_SECRET=generate_secret_string using: openssl rand -base64 32
* AUTH0_AUDIENCE=http://localhost:3000
* AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your_id_here_from_auth0
* AUTH0_BASE_URL=your_base_url_here_from_auth0

- [ ] Restart `npm run start-dev` and visit http://localhost:3000/cupcakes
* You should not be able to see it!


## Token Data Usage
GOAL: Let's personalize the homepage when a user visits

### Get the User Data
- [ ] Log the user data via `console.log(req.oidc.user)`
* You should see the information populated your terminal

- [ ] Use `req.oidc.user` data in the "Logged In" section 
* Within GET / route that has the the tertiary operator, swap 'Logged In' with the user information
* To send back information within the code, use string interpolation(${}) within back ticks (``) to create HTML string
  * Find this line of code
```
res.send(req.oidc.isAuthenticated() ? 'Logged in' : 'Logged out');
```

* Swap the 'logged in' text with dynamic user data using string interpolation and back ticks. Here's an example.

```
res.send(req.oidc.isAuthenticated() ?  
`<h1>Crypto Cupcakes</h1> 
 <h2> Welcome, ${req.oidc.user.name}<h2>` : 'Logged out');
```

<summary>Where do I find the user data?</summary>
<br>
When you console.logged your user in terminal, check out the name of the keys being used. Thanks mattix23 for explaining that to me!

## [Add the User](https://app.codingrooms.com/app/course/google-back-end-module-CHcWTMx/b/1c6fbe4c-1ca1-411b-9cc0-3bdf593f765c)

- [ ] Create a new piece of middleware that will run right after the Auth0 `auth(config)` router

```
app.use(async (req, res, next) => {
  // you'll put your logic here
});
```

- [ ] Use Sequelize‚Äôs `findOrCreate` to pass a user with their `username`, `name`, and `email`
```
const [user] = await User.findOrCreate({
  where: {
    username: "",
    name: "",
    email: ""
  }
});
```

<details close>
<summary>How to use Dynamic User Data?</summary>
<br>
Inside the middleware, you can use backticks (``) and intrepolate the req.oidc.user data.

For example: username: `${req.oidc.user.nickname}`
</details>
<br>

- [ ] Call next() before the end of the route, to allow subsequent routers/routes to be matched
```
const [user] = await User.findOrCreate({
  where: {
    // properties mentioned above
  }
});

// call the next after the variable user
next()
```
